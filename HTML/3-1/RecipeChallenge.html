        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> In a mixing bowl, toss mooli with salt. Cover, and refrigerate until 1 to 2 tablespoons of water is released, about 30 minutes.<br> 
        <strong>Step2:</strong> Drain and rinse mooli, removing as much salt as possible. Pat dry with kitchen roll, and return to bowl. Stir in rice vinegar, pepper and, if desired, sesame oil. Cover, and refrigerate at least 8 hours.<br>
        <strong>Step 3:</strong>Pound chicken breasts to 1cm (1/4 in) thickness. Sprinkle both sides of each chicken breast liberally with paprika, salt and pepper.<br>
        <strong>Step 4:</strong>In a large frying pan, melt the butter over low heat. Add the chicken breast, cover and cook over medium heat for 10 minutes. Turn chicken breasts over and layer the thinly sliced onions and mushrooms on top of the chicken. Cover and cook for 10 minutes.<br>
        <strong>Step 5:</strong>Remove lid and mix onions and mushrooms into the butter pan sauce, reduce heat to low and cook uncovered for 5 minutes.
